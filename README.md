## 👋 Hello
I'm Marshall Vielmetti, a Masters student in Electrical & Computer Engineering, with a focus in robotics and control systems at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Go Blue!)

I'm currently a research assistant with the Distributed Aerospace and Control (DASC) lab with Michigan Robotics.

I've previously worked as a Software Development Intern at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, and prior to that at Menet Aero.

I want to design the software that powers the next generation of robotic systems.

✏️ Currently Taking:
- Machine Learning for Planning & Control

📖 Currently Reading:
- Applied Nonlinear Control, Slotine
- Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction, Kirk
