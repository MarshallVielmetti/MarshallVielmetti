## ðŸ‘‹ Hello
I'm Marshall Vielmetti, a CS student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Go Blue!)

I've previously worked as a Software Development Intern at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, and prior to that at Menet Aero.

I want to design the software that powers the next generation of robotic systems.

ðŸ“– Currently Reading: 
Applied Nonlinear Control, Slotine
Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction, Kirk
