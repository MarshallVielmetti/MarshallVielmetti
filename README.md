## üëã Hello
I'm Marshall Vielmetti, a Masters student in Electrical & Computer Engineering, with a focus in robotics and control systems at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Go Blue!)

I'm currently a research assistant with the Distributed Autonomous Systems and Control (DASC) lab with Michigan Robotics. My research centers on cooperative multi-agent systems with an emphasis on safety-critical applications.

I've previously worked as a Software Development Intern at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, and prior to that at Menet Aero.

I want to design the software & algorithms that power the next generation of robotic systems.

‚úèÔ∏è Currently Taking:
- Nonlinear Programming (Convex Optimization) (IOE 611)
- Learning for Control of Aerial Vehicles (AERO 740)
- Self Driving Cars (ROB 535)

<!--
Past Coursework
- Machine Learning for Planning & Control

üìñ Currently Reading:
- Convex Optimization, Boyd
- Applied Nonlinear Control, Slotine
- Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction, Kirk
